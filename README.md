This repository hosts my submission for https://js13kgames.com/.

The game is far from being ready, but a playable prototype is already available. The gray area is the wall of a medieval castle, the blue one is a knight which you can move around by clicking.

There are several versions of the game:
* Official version: NOT YET
* Development version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2023/
* Minified version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2023/min/
