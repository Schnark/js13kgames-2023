The game is about Sir Bruno, a knight who came to sing his Minnelied, a traditional love song, to Lady Sylvie. But instead he is taken away his possesions and thrown into dungeon. Can you help him recover his things and meet Lady Sylvie? Move around, take things, and interact with them by clicking/tapping.

There are several versions of the game:
* Official version: NOT YET
* Development version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2023/
* Minified version: https://schnark.github.io/js13kgames-2023/min/
